/**
 * PEC package
 * A package containing the necessary classes to implement a simulator based on a
 * private event container. This package includes both a PEC interface and an abstract event
 * class, in order to ease implementation. It also includes the implementation
 * of the Comparator to sort the events by their timestamp, a extension of the SimulationVariables
 * class in order to include the event specific Variables as well as the implementation of 3
 * kinds of events to for the simulation made in the Simulator class inside de
 * simulator package
